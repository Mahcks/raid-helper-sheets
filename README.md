The idea behind this project is to piggyback onto Raid Helper - "a feature-rich event organization tool for discord", listening in to events, taking those details and stuffing them into a Google Sheet.

Raid Helper has a ton  of useful features that can already track attendance and more.  However, by linking the events information to a Google Sheet there is great opportunity to add and customise further organisational tools in a more accessible format.
